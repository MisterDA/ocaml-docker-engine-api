    (* A list of volume bindings for this container. Each volume binding is a string in one of these forms:  - `host-src:container-dest[:options]` to bind-mount a host path   into the container. Both `host-src`, and `container-dest` must   be an _absolute_ path. - `volume-name:container-dest[:options]` to bind-mount a volume   managed by a volume driver into the container. `container-dest`   must be an _absolute_ path.  `options` is an optional, comma-delimited list of:  - `nocopy` disables automatic copying of data from the container   path to the volume. The `nocopy` flag only applies to named volumes. - `[ro|rw]` mounts a volume read-only or read-write, respectively.   If omitted or set to `rw`, volumes are mounted read-write. - `[z|Z]` applies SELinux labels to allow or deny multiple containers   to read and write to the same volume.     - `z`: a _shared_ content label is applied to the content. This       label indicates that multiple containers can share the volume       content, for both reading and writing.     - `Z`: a _private unshared_ label is applied to the content.       This label indicates that only the current container can use       a private volume. Labeling systems such as SELinux require       proper labels to be placed on volume content that is mounted       into a container. Without a label, the security system can       prevent a container's processes from using the content. By       default, the labels set by the host operating system are not       modified. - `[[r]shared|[r]slave|[r]private]` specifies mount   [propagation behavior](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt).   This only applies to bind-mounted volumes, not internal volumes   or named volumes. Mount propagation requires the source mount   point (the location where the source directory is mounted in the   host operating system) to have the correct propagation properties.   For shared volumes, the source mount point must be set to `shared`.   For slave volumes, the mount must be set to either `shared` or   `slave`.  *)
