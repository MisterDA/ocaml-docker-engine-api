    (* An array of constraint expressions to limit the set of nodes where a task can be scheduled. Constraint expressions can either use a _match_ (`==`) or _exclude_ (`!=`) rule. Multiple constraints find nodes that satisfy every expression (AND match). Constraints can match node or Docker Engine labels as follows:  node attribute       | matches                        | example ---------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------- `node.id`            | Node ID                        | `node.id==2ivku8v2gvtg4` `node.hostname`      | Node hostname                  | `node.hostname!=node-2` `node.role`          | Node role (`manager`/`worker`) | `node.role==manager` `node.platform.os`   | Node operating system          | `node.platform.os==windows` `node.platform.arch` | Node architecture              | `node.platform.arch==x86_64` `node.labels`        | User-defined node labels       | `node.labels.security==high` `engine.labels`      | Docker Engine's labels         | `engine.labels.operatingsystem==ubuntu-14.04`  `engine.labels` apply to Docker Engine labels like operating system, drivers, etc. Swarm administrators add `node.labels` for operational purposes by using the [`node update endpoint`](#operation/NodeUpdate).  *)
